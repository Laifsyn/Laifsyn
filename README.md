- 👋 Hi, I’m @Laifsyn
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning new things and Rust
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... on how to write an UI and backend
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
- 📫 How to reach me ... GitHub (I guess?)

I found myself enjoying socializing overall. I believe knowing different perspectives can help me to 
come up with different ideas that wouldn't have been possible with just me alone.

# Summary of Experiences (Of varying levels of expertise)
All experience has been mostly been obtained through exploratory learning. I still think there's more to learn
from actual experts, and still lot's of space to improve from practical experience.
  * Programming in General
    * Back-End
    * DevOps
    * CI
    * Database
    * Writing Documentation
    * User Interface
    * Data Structures
    * Code Architecture and Design
  * Languages (With pretty decent level of expertise)
    * Rust
    * Java
    * Scripting Languages in general (Mainly AHKv2)
    * English & Chinese

## Frontend 

I have some experience designing UIs which I've overdoing university projects, but I still lack any formal education related
to UI Design outside of "Make it as user-friendly as posssible".

## Back-End

I've as lately been particularly interested on back-end related topics. I've been working on self projects tinkering with logging 
(and hopefully soon with async tracing), code architecture and design, write of robusts tests, develop Domain Driven Design (DDD in short), 
as well as familiarizing myself with the sane ways to make swift deployments of new releases.

Major Topics I'm still haven't gotten to properly understand yet are among it; managing encrypted communication, and properly exposing a public API. 
(Plus others that I might not know yet)

## Programming Languages

I currently feel pretty comfortable writing in Rust. My UI skills are pretty lacking, but I've had set my aims on either 
[Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), [Flutter-rs](https://github.com/flutter-rs/flutter-rs) and [egui](https://www.egui.rs/)
due to their advertisements of being multi-platform compatible which includes Web Assembly.


# Small Personal Projects

These projects are some small projects I had done. They should be solution for small niche problems, where 
chances are, there's way better alternatives.

## Simple Summary of projects Source Code into a `.md` file [AHK][1]
Reads (for now java) source code files and paste it at N-nested Heading into a single `.md` file. 
The purpose was to be able to copy and paste the rendered html into a word, and have a poor-man tool to navigate
source code with a PDF viewer or Word Document viewer, making use of the headings that get pasted from the `.md` file.
