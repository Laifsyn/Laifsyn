- 👋 Hi, I’m @Laifsyn
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning new things and cooking.
- 📫 How to reach me ... GitHub (I guess?)
<!-- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Interesting projects -->

Currently learning:
  - Rust
  - Java
  - Python
    - Manim
  - Javascript/Svelte

Excited for:
  - Rust and Svelte
  - Learning new things

I enjoy to be able to socialize. Learning different perspectives is interesting and help me to 
come up with different ideas that often wouldn't have been possible with just my experience alone.
