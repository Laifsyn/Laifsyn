- 👋 Hi, I’m @Laifsyn
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning new things and Rust
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... on how to write an UI and backend
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
- 📫 How to reach me ... GitHub (I guess?)


# Summary of Experiences (Of varying levels of expertise)
  * Programming in General
    * Back-End
    * DevOps
    * CI
    * Database
    * User Interface
    * Data Structures
    * Code Architecture and Design
  * Languages (With pretty decent level of expertise)
    * Rust
    * Java
    * Scripting Languages in general (Mainly AHKv2)

## Back-End

I've as lately been particularly interested on back-end related topics. I've been working on self projects tinkering with logging 
(and hopefully soon with async tracing), code architecture and design, write of robusts tests, develop Domain Driven Design (DDD in short), 
as well as familiarizing myself with the sane ways to make swift deployments of new releases.

## Programming Languages

I currently feel pretty comfortable writing in Rust. I feel I'm lacking in the UI section, but I believe I should be able to tackle this issue with
some practice

Major Topics I'm still missing couldn't get started in yet is managing an encrypted communication, and properly exposing a public API.

# Small Personal Projects

These projects are some small projects I had done. They should be solution for small niche problems, where 
chances are, there's way better alternatives.

## Simple Summary of projects Source Code into a `.md` file [AHK][1]
Reads (for now java) source code files and paste it at N-nested Heading into a single `.md` file. 
The purpose was to be able to copy and paste the rendered html into a word, and have a poor-man tool to navigate
source code with a PDF viewer or Word Document viewer, making use of the headings that get pasted from the `.md` file.
