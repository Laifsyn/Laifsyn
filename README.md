- 👋 Hi, I’m @Laifsyn
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning new things and cooking.
- 📫 How to reach me ... GitHub (I guess?)
<!-- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Interesting projects -->


Currently a Student in Systems Engineering. I tend to like to be able to put into words my decisions because it often express that they have proper meanings.


# About What I Know

I have knowledge in low level programming (baring off ASM) and the thought process it requires, Rust and couple of fairly High Level Languages like Python, javascript and Java. 

I recognize and understand nuances and trade-offs for patterns like Composition, Dependency Inversion/Injection and other pretty common design strategies meant to make code less of a pain.

I'm fairly more experienced in Rust, and then next comes Python and Java. In `Java`, I've practiced tokenization of user's input, simple parsing and some basic GUIs. In `Python` I had tried to apply some learnings from `Rust` like typing, data driven structures and I have made use of the `Manim` library to create some animations meant for university assignments.

on the side I had been working on `Tauri` with `Svelte` as frontend to design an application to piggyback from the whole javascript ecosystem and learn html/js/css and betting on the vision Svelte has for reactivity. I have some basic knowledge about mounting up a HTTP server with `Rust`'s `Axum` and `Actix-web`, writing of parsers using `nom`, and I learned some about embedding `lua` to rust with `mlua`.
